turnin code:  cs_p6


Write a C program which is statically linked to:

    ~rbutler/public/courses/cs/p6test.o

and dynamically linked to most other functions, such as printf,
but, the program should use dynamic loading to load pthread_create and
pthread_join.
You can discover the locations of the pthreads libraries by using:
    ldd -v   
on existing executables that use pthreads.
You can verify that p6test is statically in the executable by running:
    nm p6 | grep p6test
and verifying that it is type T, i.e. text instead of U unresolved.
Likewise, you can verity that printf is dynamically linked.

Create a thread which executes p6test with an integer argument equal to
the only command-line argument.  So, if I invoke your program this way:

    ./p6 9999

the program should create a thread which receives a pointer to a
long int variable that has the value 9999.
The p6test function may take a couple of seconds to complete.
The program should do a pthread_join with the thread.

TURNIN info:
    You should submit a tar file of a directory which contains all of the
    required files (makefile, C source files, header files, etc.).
    Sample tar command to create a tar file from a dir named p6dir:
	tar cvf p6.tar ./p6dir  ## do *NOT* use full pathname of the dir
    After un-tarring your project, I will cd to the dir containing
    it and type:
        rm -rf p6
        rm -f  *.o
        make
